#This is the required README file that we need to provide for trying the extra

#I put in three while loops. The first two check to see if the start_integer
#and end_integer variables are out of the range 1-100000. If so, the while loop
#will keep being called and prompting the user to enter a new value.
#The third while loop checks to make sure that end_integer is greater than
#the start_integer. The while loop executes if the start_integer is greater
#than the end_integer.
