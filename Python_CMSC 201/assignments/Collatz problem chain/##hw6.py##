#Description:     This program prints out the chain of numbers in the unusual
#                 sequence called the Collatz problem. Given a an integer
#                 or a range, the chain will be printed out. The chain's
#                 interesting propertiy is that (although with debate as to how
#                 and if it always works) given any number other than 1, if
#                 the number is even divide it by two and if it is odd,
#                 multiply it by three and add one. Eventually this should
#                 reach the number one.




#This function acts as the greater, letting the user know what the program
#will do.
def printGreeting():
    print('Hello and welcome to ')
#This function uses a while loop and prints out a single chain for each number
#in the loop.The loop will keep going until the number reaches 1. There is a
#counter that keeps track of how long the chain is and in the end returns how
#long the sequence chain is.
